    "We've already seen a bunch of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print` -- takes an argument, and prints it on the screen\n",
    "- `input` -- takes a string argument, displays it on the screen, asks the user to enter something, and then returns that user input\n",
    "- `len` -- takes a string, list, tuple, or dict, and returns its length (for some definition of \"length\")\n",
    "- `open` -- takes a string, and returns a new file object\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are also methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `str.split` -- returns a list of strings\n",
